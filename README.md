## Overview

This repository includes [codes](Optimal-Control-Problems) and [documentation](Documentation) created as a part of my *Supervised Learning Project* (SLP).
The project was guided by [Prof. Debasish Chatterjee](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~chatterjee/master/homepage/index.html) from Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

## Abstract

Here, we study the numerical methods for optimal control. In particular,
the direct methods are discussed with an objective to showcase an approach for
general optimal control problems. These methods, which include single shooting,
multiple shooting and collocation methods, are relatively simple to follow and effectively
solve a wide variety of optimization problems. We illustrate each of the
methods by working through example problems.
